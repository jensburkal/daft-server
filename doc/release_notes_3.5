Daft.Server 3.5 Release Notes


Changes from Release 3.4:

- Categories and assets can be deleted (Warning: This is completly insecure, no authentication required - this is coming in a future version)
- File monitor now supports the new preview types (max_size, scaled_box, cropped_box), and different preview formats (png, gif, jog)
- Log file tidied up, much less debug information making log file easier to analyse
- The sample web.xml file now only references standard fields in the Cumulus Sample Catalog, so is a good basis for a new installation.
- The web app is tidied up, and has new sample web page to demonstrate uploading of assets via web page (demo.html)
- A sample web page showing a simple Ajax style Gallery is included.

Bug Fixes:

- Connection pool now reconnects correctly if Cumulus connection lost, without need to restart Tomcat
- Connection pool no longer loops infinately, generating huge log file if Cumulus connection lost
- UploadServlet error when metadata sent but no file data, resulting in last field (Record Name by default) having a traiing "\n" - new line character
- Windows file monitor now working again with updated Daft.Server (3.5)

Notes:

In sample_web.xml there is a new servlet, BozoServlet. This is experimental, and you do not need to deploy this for now.

The sample web pages all reference the base url http://localhost:8083 ..., as does the gallery.js (in the js sub directory). You need to adapt
this is you want to play with the demos.

In the gallery.html sample web page the "Top Photo" id is embedded in the page (look for id "top_image_id" in the html, and set to an id you know is in your catalog)
