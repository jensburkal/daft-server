Bug Fixes:

Notes:

When running on Snow Leopard, ensure Tomcat runs with JAVA_OPTS -d32 and java.awt.headless=true
This ensures Tomcat runs in 32 bit mode, required as Cumulus native libraries are not yet 64 bit compatible.
This also ensures that the Java ImageIO libraries run correctly on Mac OSX (not required for Windows).
See the sample catalina.sh provided.

The sample_web.xml also contains views that are useful for testing Woodwing Enterprise integration.
Due to the way the Woddwing plug-in s work, it is necessary to have some conventions, so "views" in web.xml have their name prefixed with "woodwing_".
ALso there is a special "view" named "woodwing_properties" which must exist to map onto Woodwing Enterprise meta data fields.
